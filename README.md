# WS281x Raspberry PI Led Controller
This project was meant as a way for me to learn a little bit about electroics and pcb design, aswell as to be an outlet to learn rust and mess around with building a frontend for a larger project. This is very much still a WIP and I will be continuing to work on this project in my sparetime. I will do my best to document how things work and do small writeups explaining the project, if you are interested I highly encourage looking through the repository because I have readme's for each main section of this project (backend, frontend, hardware). Eventually I may document setup if anyone else is intrested in replicating this, but for now im still working on improving pretty much everything.
