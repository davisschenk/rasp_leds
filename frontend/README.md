# Frontend
I initially tried to build the frontend using ReactJS, but eventually moved to flutter because I was having a hard time relearning web design with JS/HTML/CSS, and I also just do not enjoy interacting with JS. Fortunately for me I have some previous experience developing with flutter, and it will also allow me to easily build my frontend for web, android, ios, etc with minimal effort. Currently I am just using the most basic option for state management (`setState({})`) because currently there isnt very much complex state, eventually I may opt to upgrade to another solution, but currently it works good enough. UI design is not my strong suit, but hopefully I will have this looking nice and clean eventually but for now im focused on just getting something working.
